# Python Pandas Coding Exercises

Welcome to my collection of Python Pandas exercises! This repository contains a variety of data analysis projects ranging from beginner-friendly to more advanced challenges. These exercises helped me strengthen my Pandas skills while working with real-world datasets.

## What You'll Find Here

- Practical exercises working with real-world datasets (each project includes the necessary CSV files)
- Well-documented Jupyter notebook solutions
- Demonstrations of essential Pandas operations including:
  - Data cleaning (handling missing values, dropping duplicates)
  - Data transformation (groupby, sorting, aggregation)
  - Advanced operations (merging datasets, column renaming)
  - Statistical calculations (count, sum, mean, and more)
